## Project Description
**A Cost-Effective Solution for Safer Blood Collection**
Blood bag agitators are critical for safe blood collection. They work by keeping blood in motion during donation, mixing it with anticoagulants to prevent clotting. If blood clots, it becomes unusable—which is a serious problem in settings where supply is limited and demand is constant.

The issue is that standard blood bag agitators are expensive, ranging from around $500 to over $5,000. That kind of cost makes them inaccessible to many low-resource clinics, rural hospitals, and mobile blood drives, especially in low-income countries.

BearMax is a fully functional, low-cost prototype that we built to address this problem. Our design uses a breadboard-based setup with a microcontroller that drives a motor system using fine-tuned PWM control. This allows the blood to stay in motion without damaging the cells, maintaining the quality of the donation while cutting down costs significantly.

**What We Did**
We developed a working prototype that:

Uses PWM to carefully control a DC motor for smooth, consistent agitation
Can be powered by a standard supply or adapted for battery use
Was built with modularity in mind, using breadboarding for flexibility and fast iteration

The main idea was to recreate what commercial blood agitators do, but with way more affordable parts. We wanted to keep it simple and low-cost without cutting corners on what actually matters—keeping the blood safe and usable. Most of our focus was on making sure the system worked reliably and could be used in places where resources are limited, whether that’s a rural clinic, a mobile setup, or even during emergency situations.

**Why It Matters**
Access to safe blood shouldn’t depend on whether a hospital can afford a piece of equipment. By building a low-cost alternative to a device that plays such a key role in donation safety, we’re hoping to make blood collection more accessible in underserved areas. BearMax is a step toward making that possible.

**Technologies & Skills Used**
Microcontroller programming (Arduino)
PWM-based motor control
Circuit prototyping on breadboard
Hardware-software integration
Problem-solving in constrained environments

About the Project
This project was built during BearHack, a healthcare-focused hackathon centered around real-world problems. We chose to focus on blood agitators because the problem is very specific, very real, and very solvable. This is one of those cases where thoughtful engineering can actually impact lives.
