## A Cost-Effective Solution for Safer Blood Collection

Blood bag agitators are critical for safe blood collection. They work by keeping blood in motion during donation, mixing it with anticoagulants to prevent clotting. If blood clots, it becomes unusable—which is a serious problem in settings where supply is limited and demand is constant.

The issue is that standard blood bag agitators are expensive, ranging from around $500 to over $5,000. That kind of cost makes them inaccessible to many low-resource clinics, rural hospitals, and mobile blood drives, especially in low-income countries.

BearMax is a fully functional, low-cost prototype that we built to address this problem. Our design uses a breadboard-based setup with a microcontroller that drives a motor system using fine-tuned PWM control. This allows the blood to stay in motion without damaging the cells, maintaining the quality of the donation while cutting down costs significantly.

## What We Did
### We developed a working prototype that:

- Uses PWM to carefully control a DC motor for smooth, consistent agitation
- Can be powered by a standard supply or adapted for battery use
- Was built with modularity in mind, using breadboarding for flexibility and fast iteration

The main idea was to recreate what commercial blood agitators do, but with way more affordable parts. We wanted to keep it simple and low-cost without cutting corners on what actually matters—keeping the blood safe and usable. Most of our focus was on making sure the system worked reliably and could be used in places where resources are limited, whether that’s a rural clinic, a mobile setup, or even during emergency situations.

## Why It Matters
Access to safe blood shouldn’t depend on whether a hospital can afford a piece of equipment. By building a low-cost alternative to a device that plays such a key role in donation safety, we’re hoping to make blood collection more accessible in underserved areas. BearMax is a step toward making that possible.

## About the Project
This project was built during **BearHack**, a healthcare-focused hackathon centered around designing solutions to real world medical problems. We chose to address this issue because we strongly believe that access to medical care should be a universal right, not a privilege. Just like anyone else, people in underserved contries also deserve reliable access to safe blood. In many situations, having the proper medical equipment can be the difference between life and death. By designing an affordible alternative, we are supporting equitable healthcare around the world.
